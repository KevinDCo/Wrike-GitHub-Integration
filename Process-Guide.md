# Process Guide

## Assumptions
This process guide provides a list of guidelines to follow given the following assumptions:
- Developers are assigned a seat and are team members to the 900lbs-of-Creative GitHub organization.
- All team members on the project have a seat in Wrike.
- Unito is set to sync a single Wrike directory with a corresponding GitHub Repository.
- Correct Map Fields, Filter Tasks, and Assignees have been setup on Unito.
- Through Unito, Wrike tasks have the corresponding GitHub issue linked in the Description Footer and vice/versa.

## Principles
1. **Wrike** is the central location for *communication* and *collaboration* for each project.
2. **GitHub** is the central location for *code updates* for each project.
3. **Unito** is the bridge that links *relevent meta data* for each Wrike Task/GitHub issue.

Note: Wrike Tasks listed below are assumed to be synced to GitHub through Unito. Any non-synced Wrike Task not yet sent GitHub do not apply to the below guidelines.

## Guidelines
| Do Not       | Do             | Note         |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Use slack to keep track of tasks and assets | Comment/Mention/Collaborate on your Wrike Task/Github Issue | Do your @mentions in Wrike. Unito doesn't sync them |
| Post Large files (images/videos) directly on the Wrike Task/GitHub Issue | Post a link to a google file containing the file | Large files could potentially slow Unito's syncing |
| Delete Wrike Tasks | Complete or close them | Deleting of a Wrike Task does not sync to a GitHub Issue |
| Create Wrike Tasks at the start of the project | Map users and map fields before creating tasks | If you assign someone a Wrike Task before that user is mapped, Unito will not auto-assign that in the GitHub issue. |
| Create large tasks | Create Tasks that are completable in 1-3 days | Tasks should be small enough to complete in a timely manner, yet large enough to warrant being an individual task |
